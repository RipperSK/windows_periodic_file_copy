# windows_periodic_file_copy

This is a mini project that I've coded based on a request of my friend who wanted a periodic copy of some file 
for work every X minutes so when he messed up he did not need to trace back his steps or start over from scratch

It accepts no argumets and is intended to be run interactively - asking for directory and file extension
It runs in ifinite loop and needs to be either killed with CTRL+C or by killing CMD window where it runs
